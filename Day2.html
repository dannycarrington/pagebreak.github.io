      For you to understand and acheive true greatness you must understand yourself.
It isn't neccessary for you to loathe yourself, however loving yourself 
should be a daily occurance. Many people who divulge themselves on social media
have a tendancy of being highly self-critical due to extreme standards. From the 
standpoint from someone off-the-grid it could be quite humourous but the reality
of this issue is that many young people are in such a harsh and pressured enviroments
It can cause severe mental health issues. Moving onto current world heroes, honestly 
refering to the state of the world they do not last very long in the public mind.
This is because some people say mankind has reached its peak, wether you believe
this or not there are very few ocassions where specific humans have been written down
in history in the last few centuries. In the past great figures have  always had
resistence of persistently staying in history but in recent years many heroes have been 
either wiped from history or not even cited at all. Not to dissappoint, yes some major
leaders of the world will always be set in stone but many extremely great people
will wither away. Moving foward, many people find it outragous that this astigmatism around
self-love is for the weak. Personally I believe that is is vital and people should be
refering to self-love as a normal human function. I would just like to put out there 
that self-love isn't definitely something you should do, many people say that since they
have never incorporated it into their life it seems more of a foe than a freind to do.
It has occured to me that people of a computer science background are far more likely to
to be a part of this minority. However, there is really not enough evidence to back this
up. Many of my collegues, who are in the computer science route, say that this isn't true
However, I think these are all lies. But since writing this article I believe that
there will be an assasination attempt on me in the upcoming days. I have a tendancy of writing things that usually ends me up in a situation like this. Thank you for reading, speak to
all of you soon.
